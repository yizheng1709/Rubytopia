# Rubytopia

This is a small game where the user gets to use the portal of Rubytopia and travel to any mythological place he/she wishes to go! The user can choose from a selection of Races to start their journey. Along the journey, the user will meet several kinds of Monsters as well as the cheeky Quiz Master! These Monsters are not as uncivilized as they appear to be, for they do know the meaning of kindness. But that's up to the user to believe. Are you ready to explore all the endings of this simple game?
